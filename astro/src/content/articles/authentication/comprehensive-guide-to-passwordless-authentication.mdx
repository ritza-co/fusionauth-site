## What is Passwordless Authentication?
Passwordless authentication is a modern approach to user authentication that eliminates the need for traditional passwords. Instead, it relies on alternative methods such as biometrics, magic links, one-time passwords (OTPs), or passkeys. This approach enhances security by mitigating risks associated with password theft and improves user experience by removing the
friction of remembering complex passwords.

## Why is Passwordless Authentication Important?

Password-based systems are vulnerable to attacks like phishing, credential stuffing, and brute force. Passwordless authentication addresses these challenges by:

1. Enhancing Security: Eliminates weak or reused passwords as an attack vector.
1. Improving User Experience: Reduces login friction and forgotten password issues.
1. Streamlining Onboarding: Simplifies the registration process for new users.
1. Reducing Operational Costs: Decreases password reset requests and support tickets.

## Key Methods Of Passwordless Authentication

### Magic Links​
Users receive an email containing a link that logs them in when clicked.
    - Example: A user clicks a link sent to their email to access their account.

### One-Time Passwords (OTPs)​

An OTP is a one-time password or one-time PIN (where PIN is a personal identification number).

Temporary codes sent via SMS or email for single-use login.
    - Example: A user enters a 6-digit code sent to their phone to log in.

### TOTPs ?

### Biometric Authentication​
Uses physical traits like fingerprints or facial recognition for login.-​
    - Example: A banking app authenticates users via Face ID.

### Passkeys (FIDO2/WebAuthn)​
Cryptographic keys stored on devices replace passwords entirely.
    - Example: Logging in with a fingerprint scanner on a smartphone.

## Passwordless Options Offered By FusionAuth

Let's see which types of passwordless authentication FA offers, and briefly overview how to configure them. Once you're done with article, you might want to read more detail in the official FA [documentation on passwordless authentication](https://fusionauth.io/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/passwordless/).

<Aside type="tip">
If you want to test these options yourself, you'll need two things:
- An installation of FA. The easiest way to run FA is in a Docker container. Clone the example GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-example-docker-compose). Open a terminal in the `light` subdirectory, and run `docker compose up` in a terminal to start FA. Log in at http://localhost:9011 with `admin@example.com` and `password`.
- An SMTP server to email codes or links to yourself (the example user). For a quick test, you can [configure your personal Gmail account](https://fusionauth.io/docs/customize/email-and-messages/configure-email#gmail) or use [Mailcatcher](https://mailcatcher.me). You'll learn how to set up mail in the subsection below.

For some advanced features you might also need a [paid FA license or a free community licence](https://fusionauth.io/docs/get-started/core-concepts/plans-features).
</Aside>

### Magic Links

FA supports magic links. You can configure FA to allow a user to log in with magic links in addition to, or as an alternative to, username and password authentication.

Log in to FusionAuth and follow the instructions to [configure Gmail here](https://fusionauth.io/docs/customize/email-and-messages/configure-email#gmail).

{/*
[Gmail key](../../../../public/img/articles/authentication/comprehensive-guide-to-passwordless/gmailKey.webp)

[SMTP](../../../../public/img/articles/authentication/comprehensive-guide-to-passwordless/smtp.webp)
*/}

To configure magic links, follow the [guide](https://fusionauth.io/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/passwordless/magic-links). In brief, you need to ensure that you have an email template ready to send the user (which was done for you in the [Kickstart file of the repository](https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-example-docker-compose/blob/main/light/kickstart/kickstart.json) you downloaded) and enable passwordless login in the security tab of the "application" settings (an application is the FA name for a group of users and how they are allowed to log in).

![Enable passwordless](../../../../public/img/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/passwordless/turn-on-passwordless.png)

Email templates can be customized in the tenant (a group of FA users and applications), so you can format your magic links and their accompanying message however you like.

![Templates](../../../../public/img/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/passwordless/duplicating-email-template.png)

![Template](../../../../public/img/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/passwordless/modifying-email-template.png)

Finally, you need to have a user to test the login. In the <Breadcrumb>Users</Breadcrumb> page you can add a new user with an email address you have access to (like your personal Gmail one), and then add the user to the example Changebank application (this is called a "registration" from the user to the application).

In reality, your application's login page would redirect to a FA page with matching styling, but FA also provides a standalone login page for testing purposes. On the applications page, select View to see more details about the application, including the test OAuth login page, which will be available at http://localhost:9011/oauth2/authorize?client_id=e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000%2Fauth%2Fcallback.

You'll see that the page has a magic link option.

![Magic login](../../../../public/img/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/passwordless/login-page-with-magic-link.png)

![Enter email](../../../../public/img/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/passwordless/passwordless-email-request-form.png)

If you enter your email address and click the button a login URL will be emailed to you.

![magicEmail](../../../../public/img/articles/authentication/comprehensive-guide-to-passwordless/magicEmail.webp)

Clicking this link will log you in to FA and redirect you to the website that called it (which doesn't exist since this is just a test).

For more information on magic links in FA, read the [documentation](https://fusionauth.io/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/passwordless/magic-links).

### One-Time Passwords (OTPs)​

An OTP can be used in two ways: as an alternative to entering a password, or in addition to entering a password.

FusionAuth doesn't support the former case. There isn't usually a need for this, as the process is effectively identical to being emailed a magic link for login, except the message is a PIN not a URL.

In the latter case, an OTP is called multi-factor authentication (MFA) or two-factor authentication (2FA). This isn't passwordless authentication, as you still have to enter a password, with the extra effort of entering an OTP too. However, entering an OTP does reduce some security flaws of passwords.

To configure 2FA, follow the [guide](https://fusionauth.io/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/multi-factor-authentication). In brief, you need to enable email in your tenant multi-factor tab and set multi-factor login policy to `required` for your application.

![Enable MFA in the tenant](https://fusionauth.io/img/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/tenant-settings-mfa.png)

![Enable MFA in the application](https://fusionauth.io/img/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/application-settings-mfa.png)

Now when a user logs in, they will be asked to configure MFA. In this example, you can choose email authentication.

![Set up OTP](../../../../public/img/articles/authentication/comprehensive-guide-to-passwordless/sendOtp.webp)

You'll receive a password via email.

![Receive OTP](../../../../public/img/articles/authentication/comprehensive-guide-to-passwordless/receiveOtp.webp)


After logging in, you'll be able to save recovery codes in case you lose access to your email account.

![Recovery](../../../../public/img/articles/authentication/comprehensive-guide-to-passwordless/recovery.webp)

Now that email authentication is configured, the MFA login will be simpler.

- explain synching
- add explanation of asymmetric keys:

Passkeys use asymmetric keys instead of passwords for several key reasons, which enhance security and convenience:

    Enhanced Security: Asymmetric cryptography involves two keys: a public key that can be shared and a private key that remains confidential. This setup provides several layers of protection:
        Protection against Brute Force Attacks: Since the private key remains hidden and cannot be directly guessed, passkeys are exceedingly difficult to crack through brute force methods[1][2].
        Mitigation of Common Password Vulnerabilities: Passkeys eliminate risks such as easily guessable phrases, reused passwords, and vulnerabilities to dictionary attacks[2][3].
        Non-Repudiation: Asymmetric keys allow for non-repudiation, meaning users cannot deny involvement in a transaction, reducing identity theft and fraud risks[1].

    Secure Storage: The private key is securely stored in a trusted authenticator, eliminating vulnerabilities associated with inadequate storage practices on the client side. This means no more passwords stored in insecure locations like post-it notes or mobile phone contact lists[3].

    Unique Keys: Different passkeys are automatically created for different websites, eliminating the risk of password reuse, reducing susceptibility to credential stuffing, and mitigating the impact of compromised credentials[3].

    No Secrets Sent Over the Internet: Passkeys rely on sending a signed challenge—not the actual private key—to the website during login, ensuring that the private key stays safely on the user’s device without risk of interception[3].

    Improved Database Security: With passkeys, there is no need to store passwords in databases, reducing the risk of password leaks and breaches[3].

    Resistance to Phishing: Passkeys are resistant to phishing attacks because they cannot be typed out or written down and are only valid when used on specific, user-owned devices[4].

In summary, passkeys use asymmetric keys instead of passwords to offer enhanced security, privacy, and convenience, making them a more robust and practical solution for safeguarding digital identities.
