## What is Passwordless Authentication?
Passwordless authentication is a modern approach to user authentication that eliminates the need for traditional passwords. Instead, it relies on alternative methods such as biometrics, magic links, one-time passwords (OTPs), or passkeys. This approach enhances security by mitigating risks associated with password theft and improves user experience by removing the
friction of remembering complex passwords.

## Why is Passwordless Authentication Important?

Password-based systems are vulnerable to attacks like phishing, credential stuffing, and brute force. Passwordless authentication addresses these challenges by:

1. Enhancing Security: Eliminates weak or reused passwords as an attack vector.
1. Improving User Experience: Reduces login friction and forgotten password issues.
1. Streamlining Onboarding: Simplifies the registration process for new users.
1. Reducing Operational Costs: Decreases password reset requests and support tickets.

## Key Methods Of Passwordless Authentication

### Magic Links
Users receive an email containing a link that logs them in when clicked.
    - Example: A user clicks a link sent to their email to access their account.

### One-Time Password (OTP)​

An OTP is a one-time password or one-time PIN (where PIN is a personal identification number).

Temporary codes sent via SMS or email for single-use login.
    - Example: A user enters a 6-digit code sent to their phone to log in.

### TOTP ?

### Biometric Authentication​
Uses physical traits like fingerprints or facial recognition for login.-​
    - Example: A banking app authenticates users via Face ID.

### Passkeys (FIDO2/WebAuthn)​
Cryptographic keys stored on devices replace passwords entirely.
    - Example: Logging in with a fingerprint scanner on a smartphone.

## Passwordless Options Offered By FusionAuth

Let's see which types of passwordless authentication FA offers, and briefly overview how to configure them. Once you're done with article, you might want to read more detail in the official FA [documentation on passwordless authentication](https://fusionauth.io/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/passwordless/).

<Aside type="tip">
If you want to test these options yourself, you'll need an installation of FA. The easiest way to run FA is in a Docker container. Clone the example GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-example-docker-compose). Open a terminal in the `light` subdirectory, and run `docker compose up` in a terminal to start FA. Log in at http://localhost:9011 with `admin@example.com` and `password`.

Using passkeys requires [a free community license](https://fusionauth.io/docs/get-started/core-concepts/plans-features). Some advanced features might require a paid license.
</Aside>

### Magic Link

FA supports magic links. You can configure FA to allow a user to log in with magic links in addition to, or as an alternative to, username and password authentication.

Log in to FusionAuth and in the <Breadcrumb>Tenants</Breadcrumb> page, edit the default tenant. In the <Breadcrumb>Email</Breadcrumb> tab, set the <InlineField>Host</InlineField> to `mail.smtpbucket.com` and the <InlineField>Port</InlineField> to `8025`. [SMTPBucket](https://www.smtpbucket.com) is a free online mail testing service. To configure other email providers for a real service, follow the [SMTP guide](https://fusionauth.io/docs/customize/email-and-messages).

To configure magic links, follow the [guide](https://fusionauth.io/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/passwordless/magic-links). In brief, you need to ensure that you have an email template ready to send the user (which was done for you in the [Kickstart file of the repository](https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-example-docker-compose/blob/main/light/kickstart/kickstart.json) you downloaded) and enable passwordless login in the security tab of the application settings (an application is the FA name for a group of users and how they are allowed to log in).

![Enable passwordless](../../../../public/img/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/passwordless/turn-on-passwordless.png)

Email templates can be customized in the tenant (a group of FA users and applications), so you can format your magic links and their accompanying message how you want.

![Templates](../../../../public/img/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/passwordless/duplicating-email-template.png)

![Template](../../../../public/img/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/passwordless/modifying-email-template.png)

Finally, you need to have a user to test the login. In the <Breadcrumb>Users</Breadcrumb> page you can add a new user with an email address, and then add the user to the example Changebank application (this is called a "registration" from the user to the application).

In reality, your application's login page would redirect to a FA page with matching styling, but FA also provides a standalone login page for testing purposes. On the applications page, select View to see more details about the application, including the test OAuth login page, which will be available at http://localhost:9011/oauth2/authorize?client_id=e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000%2Fauth%2Fcallback.

You'll see that the page has a magic link option.

![Magic login](../../../../public/img/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/passwordless/login-page-with-magic-link.png)

![Enter email](../../../../public/img/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/passwordless/passwordless-email-request-form.png)

If you enter your email address and click the button a login URL will be emailed to you.

![magicEmail](../../../../public/img/articles/authentication/comprehensive-guide-to-passwordless/magicEmail.webp)

Clicking this link will log you in to FA and redirect you to the website that called it (which doesn't exist since this is just a test).

For more information on magic links in FA, read the [documentation](https://fusionauth.io/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/passwordless/magic-links).

### One-Time Password (OTP)​

An OTP can be used in two ways: as an alternative to entering a password, or in addition to entering a password.

FusionAuth doesn't support the former case. There isn't usually a need for this, as the process is effectively identical to being emailed a magic link for login, except the message is a PIN not a URL.

In the latter case, an OTP is called multi-factor authentication (MFA) or two-factor authentication (2FA). This isn't passwordless authentication, as you still have to enter a password, with the extra effort of entering an OTP too. However, entering an OTP does reduce some security flaws of passwords.

To configure 2FA, follow the [guide](https://fusionauth.io/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/multi-factor-authentication). In brief, you need to enable email in your tenant multi-factor tab and set multi-factor login policy to `required` for your application.

![Enable MFA in the tenant](https://fusionauth.io/img/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/tenant-settings-mfa.png)

![Enable MFA in the application](https://fusionauth.io/img/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/application-settings-mfa.png)

Now when a user logs in, they will be asked to configure MFA. In this example, you can choose email authentication. Log in at this [URL](http://localhost:9011/oauth2/authorize?client_id=e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000%2Fauth%2Fcallback).

![Set up OTP](../../../../public/img/articles/authentication/comprehensive-guide-to-passwordless/sendOtp.webp)

You'll receive a password via email.

![Receive OTP](../../../../public/img/articles/authentication/comprehensive-guide-to-passwordless/receiveOtp.webp)

After logging in, you'll be able to save recovery codes in case you lose access to your email account.

![Recovery](../../../../public/img/articles/authentication/comprehensive-guide-to-passwordless/recovery.webp)

Now that email authentication is configured, the MFA login will be simpler.

![Send OTP](../../../../public/img/articles/authentication/comprehensive-guide-to-passwordless/sendOtp2.webp)

### Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP)​

A TOTP authentication flow is similar to an OTP. The user enters an OTP, that changes every thirty seconds, on the FA login page from an app on their phone. The user configures TOTPs by entering a secret key shared between FusionAuth and an authenticator app on their phone. All apps use the same protocol, so the user can choose their favourite app. However, a phone must be used, because FA presents the shared secret as a QA code that has to be photographed.

![TOTP](../../../../public/img/articles/authentication/comprehensive-guide-to-passwordless/totp.webp)

Follow the [guide](https://fusionauth.io/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/multi-factor-authentication) to enable TOTP. You won't need to use any email templates.

### Passkeys (FIDO2/WebAuthn)​

Configure passkeys using the [guide](https://fusionauth.io/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/passwordless/webauthn-passkeys). In brief, you need only enable them in the WebAuthn tab of the tenant, including the bootstrap and re-authentication protocols (for creating and reusing passkeys). Like all other authentication options you've seen so far, you can override tenant settings for different applications.

![Enable tenant passkeys](https://fusionauth.io/img/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/passwordless/tenant-enable-webauthn.png)

Now when you browse to the [application login page](http://localhost:9011/oauth2/authorize?client_id=e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000%2Fauth%2Fcallback), you'll see there is an option to log in with fingerprint or device (i.e. passkey) for richard@example.com.

![Log in with passkey](../../../../public/img/articles/authentication/comprehensive-guide-to-passwordless/selectPasskey.webp)

However, you'll see that no passkeys are found on your device. This is because you can't use passkeys in FusionAuth without setting them up first: either when a user first registers, or in the FA self-service account page.

![No passkey found](../../../../public/img/articles/authentication/comprehensive-guide-to-passwordless/noPasskey.webp)

You will need to direct your existing users to the self-service account management page to create a passkey, which can be found on the <Breadcrumb>Application -> View</Breadcrumb> page in FA. In this localhost example, the self-service page is [here](http://localhost:9011/account/?client_id=e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e).

![Add passkey to existing user](../../../../public/img/articles/authentication/comprehensive-guide-to-passwordless/addPasskey.webp)

The user registration URL for localhost can be found in the same way. It's [here](http://localhost:9011/oauth2/register?client_id=e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000%2Fauth%2Fcallback). First, you have to enable self-service registration for any user in the application settings (as opposed to having an administrator enter users' email addresses and sending them invitations).

![Enable registration](../../../../public/img/articles/authentication/comprehensive-guide-to-passwordless/enableRegistration.webp)

Now you, as a user, can browse to the registration URL and register with any email address and password you want. (For testing purposes, it's faster if you as the administrator disabled verifying email addresses in the application settings).

![Register](../../../../public/img/articles/authentication/comprehensive-guide-to-passwordless/register.webp)

On the next page of the registration you can choose to create passkeys.

![Register passkey](../../../../public/img/articles/authentication/comprehensive-guide-to-passwordless/registerPasskey.webp)

After these steps are done, you can [log in](http://localhost:9011/oauth2/authorize?client_id=e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000%2Fauth%2Fcallback) with your passkey in future.

![Log in with passkey](../../../../public/img/articles/authentication/comprehensive-guide-to-passwordless/loginPasskey.webp)

<Aside type="danger">
As you probably noticed, your new user still had to enter a password at registration. This is because FA doesn't yet offer a fully passwordless user experience. There is an open [Github issue](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/484) for this feature since 2020. If avoiding passwords entirely is important to you, please vote and comment on this issue to increase its priority for the FA programmers.
</Aside>

### Using The FA API

You can use the FA API to perform the same login tasks the user performed in the previous sections, programmatically. For example, even though you can style the FA login pages to look however you want, you could create an extremely custom login page that is built in to your existing website if you use the API. Instead of the user entering credentials on the FA login page, the user would enter them on your website, which forwards the credentials to FA.

A more common use-case than logging in, is to ask the user to securely confirm a decision and re-authenticate themselves. For example, when making a purchase on your site.

This is one time where having a more onerous authentication flow is preferable to a faster one. For example, assume a user's child is playing on their parent's computer and is trying to buy something without permission. If the user relies on passkeys, the child can click the passkey in the desktop browser when it pops up. If the user instead uses SMS OTPs, or a TOTP on their phone, it would be much more difficult for the child. Passkeys could be made more secure by the user enabling the browser setting to enter a PIN before accessing the passkey vault. This relies on the user to set up, and is not something your website or FA can enforce.

Let's take a quick look at what an API call would look like for an OTP request or passkey authentication request from your website to FA.

For an OTP (MFA), FusionAuth calls re-authentication "Step Up Auth", which is documented [here](https://fusionauth.io/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/multi-factor-authentication#step-up-auth).

From Brad:

```
> I’d say using examples with FusionAuth is preferred. This is more informational, less about sales, but I still would like our software to be the example.
> We do support biometrics, via passkeys/webauthn.
> Definitely list us as hybrid.
> Feel free to move things around and combine them as you see fit. I just wanted to give you a starting point, but it’s not set in stone.

- explain synching
- add explanation of asymmetric keys:

Passkeys use asymmetric keys instead of passwords for several key reasons, which enhance security and convenience:

    Enhanced Security: Asymmetric cryptography involves two keys: a public key that can be shared and a private key that remains confidential. This setup provides several layers of protection:
        Protection against Brute Force Attacks: Since the private key remains hidden and cannot be directly guessed, passkeys are exceedingly difficult to crack through brute force methods[1][2].
        Mitigation of Common Password Vulnerabilities: Passkeys eliminate risks such as easily guessable phrases, reused passwords, and vulnerabilities to dictionary attacks[2][3].
        Non-Repudiation: Asymmetric keys allow for non-repudiation, meaning users cannot deny involvement in a transaction, reducing identity theft and fraud risks[1].

    Secure Storage: The private key is securely stored in a trusted authenticator, eliminating vulnerabilities associated with inadequate storage practices on the client side. This means no more passwords stored in insecure locations like post-it notes or mobile phone contact lists[3].

    Unique Keys: Different passkeys are automatically created for different websites, eliminating the risk of password reuse, reducing susceptibility to credential stuffing, and mitigating the impact of compromised credentials[3].

    No Secrets Sent Over the Internet: Passkeys rely on sending a signed challenge—not the actual private key—to the website during login, ensuring that the private key stays safely on the user’s device without risk of interception[3].

    Improved Database Security: With passkeys, there is no need to store passwords in databases, reducing the risk of password leaks and breaches[3].

    Resistance to Phishing: Passkeys are resistant to phishing attacks because they cannot be typed out or written down and are only valid when used on specific, user-owned devices[4].

In summary, passkeys use asymmetric keys instead of passwords to offer enhanced security, privacy, and convenience, making them a more robust and practical solution for safeguarding digital identities.
