## What is Passwordless Authentication?
Passwordless authentication is a modern approach to user authentication that eliminates the
need for traditional passwords. Instead, it relies on alternative methods such as biometrics,
magic links, one-time passwords (OTPs), or passkeys. This approach enhances security by
mitigating risks associated with password theft and improves user experience by removing the
friction of remembering complex passwords.

## Why is Passwordless Authentication Important?

Password-based systems are vulnerable to attacks like phishing, credential stuffing, and brute
force. Passwordless authentication addresses these challenges by:

1. Enhancing Security: Eliminates weak or reused passwords as an attack vector.
1. Improving User Experience: Reduces login friction and forgotten password issues.
1. Streamlining Onboarding: Simplifies the registration process for new users.
1. Reducing Operational Costs: Decreases password reset requests and support tickets.


## Key Methods of Passwordless Authentication

1. Magic Links​
Users receive an email containing a link that logs them in when clicked.
    - Example: A user clicks a link sent to their email to access their account.

2. One-Time Passwords (OTPs)​
Temporary codes sent via SMS or email for single-use login.
    - Example: A user enters a 6-digit code sent to their phone to log in.

3. Biometric Authentication​
Uses physical traits like fingerprints or facial recognition for login.-​
    - Example: A banking app authenticates users via Face ID.

4. Passkeys (FIDO2/WebAuthn)​
Cryptographic keys stored on devices replace passwords entirely.
    - Example: Logging in with a fingerprint scanner on a smartphone.

## Benefits of Passwordless Authentication

1. Stronger Security
    - Reduces the risk of phishing and credential theft.
    - Leverages multi-factor authentication (MFA) principles without requiring
passwords.
2. Improved User Experience
    - Faster logins with fewer steps.
    - No need to remember or reset passwords.
3. Scalability and Flexibility
    - Adapts to various platforms and devices.
    - Supports diverse use cases across B2C, B2B, and internal applications.
4. Compliance Made Easier
    -​ Helps meet data protection regulations like GDPR by minimizing sensitive data storage.

## Challenges Solved by Passwordless Authentication

1. Credential Theft Mitigation: Protects against phishing, brute force attacks, and credential stuffing.
2. Onboarding Simplification: Removes barriers for new users with seamless registration flows.
3. Improved Accessibility: Enables secure login options for users with disabilities who may struggle with traditional keyboards or password entry.
4. Cost Reduction: Lowers IT support costs related to password management.

## Passwordless Authentication Use Cases

1. Consumer Applications (B2C)
    - E-commerce platforms use magic links for quick logins during checkout.
2. Enterprise Applications (B2B)
    - Employees access corporate tools using biometric authentication or passkeys.
3. Highly Regulated Industries
    - Financial services implement passwordless systems to meet strict security requirements while improving customer satisfaction.
4. IoT Devices
    - Smart home devices use passkeys or mobile-based authentication for secure access without screens or keyboards.
