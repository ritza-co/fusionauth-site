## What is Passwordless Authentication?
Passwordless authentication is a modern approach to user authentication that eliminates the
need for traditional passwords. Instead, it relies on alternative methods such as biometrics,
magic links, one-time passwords (OTPs), or passkeys. This approach enhances security by
mitigating risks associated with password theft and improves user experience by removing the
friction of remembering complex passwords.

## Why is Passwordless Authentication Important?

Password-based systems are vulnerable to attacks like phishing, credential stuffing, and brute
force. Passwordless authentication addresses these challenges by:

1. Enhancing Security: Eliminates weak or reused passwords as an attack vector.
1. Improving User Experience: Reduces login friction and forgotten password issues.
1. Streamlining Onboarding: Simplifies the registration process for new users.
1. Reducing Operational Costs: Decreases password reset requests and support tickets.


## Key Methods of Passwordless Authentication

### Magic Links​
Users receive an email containing a link that logs them in when clicked.
    - Example: A user clicks a link sent to their email to access their account.

You need to configure an SMTP provider for your FA tenant. For a quick test, you can [use your personal Gmail account](https://fusionauth.io/docs/customize/email-and-messages/configure-email#gmail).

Clone the light repository. Login to 9011 and enter Reactor key.
[Enable Google account 2FA](https://myaccount.google.com/security).
Browse to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
Add app `fa`.
Record the password.
Log in to 9011 and go to tenant and follow https://fusionauth.io/docs/customize/email-and-messages/configure-email#gmail.

To configure magic links, follow the [guide](https://fusionauth.io/docs/lifecycle/authenticate-users/passwordless/magic-links). (You can use the API to get a magic link for a user, and send it to them using any mechanism you want instead of email).

TODO, update article above on email templates.

You need to have email templates enabled for the tenant for magic links to work.

### One-Time Passwords (OTPs)​
Temporary codes sent via SMS or email for single-use login.
    - Example: A user enters a 6-digit code sent to their phone to log in.

### Biometric Authentication​
Uses physical traits like fingerprints or facial recognition for login.-​
    - Example: A banking app authenticates users via Face ID.

### Passkeys (FIDO2/WebAuthn)​
Cryptographic keys stored on devices replace passwords entirely.
    - Example: Logging in with a fingerprint scanner on a smartphone.

### Clean Up
Delete Gmail app password at https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
Turn off 2FA at https://myaccount.google.com/security

## Benefits of Passwordless Authentication

1. Stronger Security
    - Reduces the risk of phishing and credential theft.
    - Leverages multi-factor authentication (MFA) principles without requiring
passwords.
2. Improved User Experience
    - Faster logins with fewer steps.
    - No need to remember or reset passwords.
3. Scalability and Flexibility
    - Adapts to various platforms and devices.
    - Supports diverse use cases across B2C, B2B, and internal applications.
4. Compliance Made Easier
    - Helps meet data protection regulations like GDPR by minimizing sensitive data storage.

## Challenges Solved by Passwordless Authentication

1. Credential Theft Mitigation: Protects against phishing, brute force attacks, and credential stuffing.
2. Onboarding Simplification: Removes barriers for new users with seamless registration flows.
3. Improved Accessibility: Enables secure login options for users with disabilities who may struggle with traditional keyboards or password entry.
4. Cost Reduction: Lowers IT support costs related to password management.

## Passwordless Authentication Use Cases

1. Consumer Applications (B2C)
    - E-commerce platforms use magic links for quick logins during checkout.
2. Enterprise Applications (B2B)
    - Employees access corporate tools using biometric authentication or passkeys.
3. Highly Regulated Industries
    - Financial services implement passwordless systems to meet strict security requirements while improving customer satisfaction.
4. IoT Devices
    - Smart home devices use passkeys or mobile-based authentication for secure access without screens or keyboards.

## Developer's Checklist for Evaluating Passwordless Solutions

- Does the solution support modern standards like WebAuthn or FIDO2?
- Are APIs well-documented and compatible with preferred programming languages?
- Can the solution handle large-scale user bases effectively?
- Is the pricing model transparent and scalable?

## Ready to Go Passwordless?



## TODO
- FA
- add corporate trust Apple/MS/Google to security risks article.
- explain biometric local storage vs master password cloud storage distinction - check with niel. biometrics are for convenience, not security.
