In this quickstart, you will build an application with {frontmatter.technology} and integrate it with FusionAuth. The application is for [ChangeBank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkH-kD73QUM), a global leader in converting dollars into coins. It will have areas reserved for logged in users and public-facing sections.

Find the Docker Compose file and source code for the complete application at <a href={frontmatter.url}>{frontmatter.url}</a>.

## Prerequisites

For this Quickstart, you'll need:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com), version 20 or later, which is the quickest way to start FusionAuth. (There are [other ways](/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/)).

You will also run PHP 8, Composer, and Apache in Docker. Using Docker allows this tutorial to be usable on Windows, Linux, and MacOS.

If you are experienced in PHP, you are welcome to install everything on your host machine instead, but you will have to convert some commands to work on your operating system.

## General Architecture

While this sample application doesn't have login functionality without FusionAuth, a more typical integration will replace an existing login system with FusionAuth.

In that case, the system might look like this before FusionAuth is introduced.

<LoginBefore alt={"Request flow during login before FusionAuth"}/>

The login flow will look like this after FusionAuth is introduced.

<LoginAfter alt={"Request flow during login after FusionAuth"}/>

In general, you would introduce FusionAuth to normalize and consolidate user data, making it consistent and up-to-date and offloading your login security and functionality to FusionAuth.

## Getting Started

Start with getting FusionAuth up and running and creating a new {frontmatter.technology} application.

### Clone The Code

First, grab the code from the repository and change into that folder.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-php-web.git
cd fusionauth-quickstart-php-web
mkdir your-application
```

All shell commands in this guide can be entered in a terminal in this folder. On Windows, you need to replace forward slashes with backslashes in paths.

All the files you'll create in this guide already exist in the `complete-application` subfolder, if you prefer to copy them to `your-application`.

### Run FusionAuth Via Docker

You'll find a Docker Compose file `docker-compose.yml` and an environment variables configuration file `.env` in the root folder of the repository.

Assuming you have Docker installed, you can start FusionAuth on your machine with the following.

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

This will start four containers, one each for FusionAuth, Postgres, Elasticsearch, and PHP.

Here you are using a bootstrapping feature of FusionAuth, called [Kickstart](/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/kickstart). When FusionAuth starts for the first time, it will look at the `kickstart/kickstart.json` file and configure FusionAuth to your specified state.

<Aside type="note">
If you ever want to reset the FusionAuth system, delete the volumes created by `docker-compose` by executing `docker compose down -v`, then rerun `docker compose up -d`.
</Aside>

FusionAuth will be configured with these settings:

* Your client Id is `e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e`.
* Your client secret is `super-secret-secret-that-should-be-regenerated-for-production`.
* Your example username is `richard@example.com` and the password is `password`.
* Your admin username is `admin@example.com` and the password is `password`.
* The base URL of FusionAuth is `http://localhost:9011/`.

You can log in to the [FusionAuth admin UI](http://localhost:9011/admin) and look around if you want to, but with Docker and Kickstart, everything will already be configured correctly.

<Aside type="caution">
  The `.env` and `kickstart.json` files contain passwords. In a real application, always add these files to your `.gitignore` file and never commit secrets to version control.
</Aside>

### The Basic {frontmatter.technology} Application

The `--volume ./your-application://var/www/html` parameter shares your current folder with the container, so both your physical machine and Docker can read and write the same files.

While this guide builds a new {frontmatter.technology} project, you can use the same method to integrate your existing project with FusionAuth.

Before starting coding, you need to install the PHP module for FusionAuth communication. Run the following code in a terminal.

```bash
docker run --rm -v ./your-application:/app composer require   vlucas/phpdotenv   jerryhopper/oauth2-fusionauth
```

<Aside type="note">
Note that the Dockerfile configures Apache to use the `public` directory as what is available on the web, to hide `vendor` and configuration files. If you're not using Docker, you will have to do this yourself.

```Dockerfile
RUN sed -i 's|/var/www/html|/var/www/html/public|g' /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
RUN sed -i 's|/var/www/html|/var/www/html/public|g' /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
```
</Aside>

## Authentication

Authentication in {frontmatter.technology} is managed by [Jerry Hopper's Provider](https://github.com/jerryhopper/oauth2-fusionauth) for [The League's OAuth library.](https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-client)


Make the file `your-application/.env`, and insert the following lines.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/your-application/.env"}
  lang="php"
  tags="fusionauth" />

<Aside type="note">
If you're not using Docker, you can change the server URL to match the browser URL, as all network communication will be you on your physical machine.
</Aside>

This tells {frontmatter.technology} where to find and connect to FusionAuth.

Authentication is handled by two files: `login.php` and `logout.php`.

The login file is based almost exactly on Jerry Hopper's code, but does two extra things: start a session, and save user details to the session after login.

Make the file `your-application/public/login.php` and insert the following code.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/your-application/public/login.php"}
  lang="php"
  tags="fusionauth" />




Make the file `your-application/public/logout.php` and insert the following code.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/your-application/public/logout.php"}
  lang="php" />

This eradicates the session on the server for this user and redirects her back to the homepage.

## Customization

Now that authentication is done, the last task is to create example pages that a user can access only when logged in.

### CSS And HTML

Copy over some CSS and images from the example app.

```shell
cp ../complete-application/public/changebank.css public/changebank.css
cp ../complete-application/public/money.jpg public/money.jpg
cp ../complete-application/public/changebank.svg public/changebank.svg
```

Next, create an `index.blade.php` file.

```shell
touch resources/views/index.blade.php
```

Paste the following code into the file.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/resources/views/index.blade.php"}
  lang="php" />

The index page contains nothing to note except a link to the login page `<a href="/login">`.

Next, create an `account.blade.php` file.

```shell
touch resources/views/account.blade.php
```

Paste the following code into the file.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/resources/views/account.blade.php"}
  lang="php" />

The account page displays the user's email from FusionAuth, as you'll see later when you create the route `<p class="header-email">{{$email}}</p>`.

Next, create a `change.blade.php` file.

```shell
touch resources/views/change.blade.php
```



Paste the following code into the file.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/resources/views/change.blade.php"}
  lang="php" />

The change page uses some Blade conditional statements to display different divs depending on the state returned by the form POST `@if ($state['error'] && $state['hasChange'])`.

The change page also includes a `@csrf` anti-forgery token in the form at the bottom to prevent {frontmatter.technology} throwing page expired errors.

### Route

In the file `your-application/routes/web.php`, overwrite everything with the code below.

<RemoteCode
  url={frontmatter.codeRoot + "/complete-application/routes/web.php"}
  lang="php" />

The homepage route `/` checks whether you are logged in and redirects you to your account page if you are.

After login, FusionAuth redirects you to the `/auth/callback` route. Use Socialite to update the user model in the database with `$user = User::updateOrCreate([`, then start a session for the user with `Auth::login($user);`.

Logout ends the session with `Auth::logout();`.

The account and change routes both include the user's email in the page template data, `return view('account', ['email' => Auth::user()->email]);`. Both routes use middleware to prevent users without a session from seeing the page, `})->middleware('auth');`.

Finally, the change route has both a GET and a POST version. Both versions return the same view, but the POST route does a calculation and includes more template data.

## Run The Application

From the `your-application` directory, run the following command.

```shell
php artisan serve
```

Browse to [the app](http://localhost:8000) at http://localhost:8000. Log in using `richard@example.com` and `password`. The change page will allow you to enter a number. Log out and verify that you can't browse to the [account page](http://localhost:8000/account).

## Next Steps

This quickstart is a great way to get a proof of concept up and running quickly, but to run your application in production, there are some things you're going to want to do.

### FusionAuth Customization

FusionAuth gives you the ability to customize just about everything to do with the user's experience and the integration of your application. This includes:

* [Hosted pages](/docs/v1/tech/themes/) such as login, registration, email verification, and many more.
* [Email templates](/docs/v1/tech/email-templates/email-templates).
* [User data and custom claims in access token JWTs](/articles/tokens/jwt-components-explained).

### Security

* You may want to customize the [token expiration times and policies](/docs/v1/tech/oauth/#configure-application-oauth-settings) in FusionAuth.
* Choose [password rules](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/tenants#password) and a [hashing algorithm](/docs/v1/tech/reference/password-hashes) that meet your security needs.

### Tenant And Application Management

* Model your application topology using [Applications](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/applications), [Roles](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/roles), [Groups](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/groups), [Entities](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/groups), and more.
* Set up [MFA](/docs/v1/tech/guides/multi-factor-authentication), [Social login](/docs/v1/tech/identity-providers/), or [SAML](/docs/v1/tech/identity-providers/samlv2/) integrations.
* Integrate with external systems using [Webhooks](/docs/v1/tech/events-webhooks/), [SCIM](/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/scim), and [Lambdas](/docs/v1/tech/lambdas/).

## Troubleshooting

- I get "This site can’t be reached localhost refused to connect" when I click the Login button.

Ensure FusionAuth is running in the Docker container. You should be able to log in as the admin user `admin@example.com` with a password of `password` at [http://localhost:9011/admin](http://localhost:9011/admin).


- {frontmatter.technology} says there is an invalid state exception.

Browse to the homepage, log out, and try to log in again. If that still doesn't work, delete and restart all the containers.

- It still doesn't work.

You can always pull down a complete running application and compare what's different.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-quickstart-php-laravel-web.git
cd fusionauth-quickstart-php-laravel-web
docker compose up -d
cd complete-application
composer install
touch database/database.sqlite
php artisan migrate
php artisan serve
```

Browse to the app at http://localhost:8000.
