## Introduction

In this guide, we will explain how to connect FusionAuth to Datadog through docker 
-	with the use of an OpenTelemetry Linux collector
- by using the Datadog Agent 
-  and adding logs or events using the Datadog API. 
We will create and set up a Datadog account and create a dashboard to monitor FusionAuth metrics.

> [Datadog integrates and automates infrastructure monitoring, application performance monitoring, log management, real-user monitoring, and many other capabilities to provide unified, real-time observability and security for our customers’ entire technology stack. Datadog is used by organizations of all sizes and across a wide range of industries to enable digital transformation and cloud migration, drive collaboration among development, operations, security and business teams, accelerate time to market for applications, reduce time to problem resolution, secure applications and infrastructure, understand user behavior, and track key business metrics.](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/application/)

## FusionAuth Metrics

Before reading this guide, please read the [FusionAuth guide to monitoring](https://fusionauth.io/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/monitor) to understand what metrics are available and choose the ones relevant to your needs.
Fusion auth exposes a prometeus Endpoint ,  but to use it we must generate a api key and give permission the get request with the steps below.
- Login to your FusionAuth instance.
- Navigate to settings
- Click on the API keys link
- On the top right of the screen click on the creen + to add a new API key
![Enable-APIKey-Prometheus-Endpoint-FusionAuth](/img/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/datadog-fusionauth-enableapikey-prometheus-endpoint.png)
- Enter a description for the API to identify it 
- Scroll down and add the GET permission on the endpoint :/api/prometheus/metrics
- Click on the blue save button on the top
- Go back to the previos screen, Click on the Red lock next to the API key you generated to copy teh value of the key.

## Datadog Metrics
 
Please read the following documentation about metrics with Datadog to get a better understanding.
- General introduction on metrics with Datadog(https://docs.datadoghq.com/metrics/).
- OpenTelemetry is discussed [here](https://docs.datadoghq.com/opentelemetry/?_ga=2.63663855.1324212944.1718441678-2001470719.1718441677&_gac=1.150758018.1718441678.EAIaIQobChMI1OXNip7dhgMV_UNBAh1xfQDYEAAYASAAEgIBs_D_BwE).

## Datadog Setup

### Signup for a free Datadog trial account. 
- Navigate to Datadog [site](https://www.datadoghq.com/). 
- Click on the 'GET STARTED FREE' link and complete the registration form to get a 14-day trial. 
  <Aside type="note">
    Make a note of where you choose your data to be hosted as that will determine the URL you use later, for this guide we use United States (US5-Central) ).
    i.e. us5.datadoghq.com
  </Aside>
![Signup-Datadog-Trail](/img/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/signup-datadog-trial.png)
- After completing the account registration you will be redirected to the 'agent intstallation' page. 

### Setup the Datadog Agent

The Datadog Agent collects metrics and events from your systems and apps. It can be installed anywhere, even on your workstation.
- We will update FusionAuth DockerFile by adding the ubuntu agent in there
- Save the Dockerfile from the FusionAuth official image to your computer. 
Edit the file. 
Above the paragraph labelled ###### Start FusionAuth App, insert the code below.
...

So click on the ubuntu agent and add this to the DockerFile..... describer  .... it should already contain your apikey
rebuild the DockerFile .. link to docker
```bash
DD_API_KEY=<yourapikey> DD_SITE="us5.datadoghq.com" bash -c "$(curl -L https://s3.amazonaws.com/dd-agent/scripts/install_script_agent7.sh)"
```
![Install-Datadog-Agent-Ubuntu](/img/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/install-datadog-agent-ubuntu.png)

Start the docker containers using dovker-compose .... link to get base docker-compose 
docker-compose.exe  -f .\docker-compose.yml  up     -d
<Aside type="note">
  For more information or manual confuguration, or troubleshooting see the "Manual Step by Step Instructions on the agent setup page.
</Aside>

---docker exec -u root    -it 82  /bin/bash

When the agent is successfully installed and started you will get screen will refresh and indicate that it recieved reports from the agent
Click on finish to contiue.


### Creating your first Dashboard
![Datadog-Agent-Reporting](/img/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/datadog-agent-reporting.png)

On the create dashboard tab, click on the create dashboard button.
![Datadog-Agent-Reporting](/img/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/datadog-website-create-dashboard.png)
- Name the dashboard
- You can select the team, if you have organizations configured, we will ignore it for this guide.
- You can select your prefered layout, 
- Click on 'New Dashboard'
![Datadog-Agent-Reporting](/img/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/datadog-website-create-new-dashboard.png)

<Aside type="note">
some of the metrics can query is listed below, others in the documents attached. We will add someintegrations soon to monitor more metrics
- datadog.agent.python.version
- datadog.agent.running
- datadog.agent.started
- datadog.agent.retry_queue_duration.by_bytes_per_sec
- datadog.agent.retry_queue_duration.capacity_bytes
- datadog.agent.retry_queue_duration.capacity_secs
- ntp.offset
- cpu 
- procss memory usage
- load average
- memmory breakdown
- available swap
- diskusage by device
- disk latency 
- network trafic
</Aside>

Add data to the dashboard. 
1. For visualization we choose TimeSeries
2. we add the following  to Metrics to monitor  
  - system.net.bytes_rcvd
  -system.net.bytes_sent
  On the right side We change the color to yellow  in the one metric do see the difference.
3) For the time preference choose "last 15 minutes"
4) Give a title to the graph
Click on save.

This is what it look like on the dashboard page
![Datadog-Website-New-Dashboard-Configuration](/img/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/datadog-website-new-dashboard-preview.png)

## Adding OpenMetrics Integration in Datadog.

Fusion auth expose a prometheus endpoint and that can be monitored by a "openMetric" Integration in datadog
- On the Main Datadog website, Click on the Integrations tab in the bottom left.
- Search for openmetrics, and click on the tile presented
![Datadog-Website-Integrations-OpenMetrics](/img/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/datadog-openmetrics-install-integration.png)
The Instalation consist of 2 parts. 
- Click on the installation button top right.
- Configured the OpenMertics Section in the agent. ....
configure api key to allow preomethous metrics on fusion auth instance....

The following sample config file
``` yaml
init_config:
instances:
  - prometheus_url: http://localhost:9011/api/prometheus/metrics  
    namespace: Fusionauth_docker_metrics_openmetric_agent #any name that you want reflected in datadog
    metrics:
      - '*'
    headers:
      Authorization: '<your Datadog API key>'
      Content-Type: 'application/json'
``` 

this file need to be copied to the folder after the instalation of datadog agent to send metrics to datadog
added this part to the DockerFile, before the section `### start the agent ###`
``` bash
  # Copy the OpenMetrics configuration file
    COPY openmedtrics.d-conf.yaml /etc/datadog-agent/conf.d/openmetrics.d/conf.yaml
```

After the datadog container and the datadog agent was succesfully started it should start sending  data to datadog.
below is a sample of dataa being send.
You can add a new dasboard time display these metrics, using the same steps as [Creating Your First Dashboard](### Creating your first Dashboard).
Make sure that you use your namespace  from the config file e.g. `Fusionauth_docker_metrics_openmetric_agent` to search for metrics to add from this agent.

![Datadog Openmetrics Dashboard](/img/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/datadog-openmetrics-dashboard.png)


### Adding datadog agent on remote host to capture prometheus/open metric data

It is also possible to isntall the Datadog agent on a seperate machine to monitor Prometheus metrics from a remote fusionauth host. We will install the `Windows datadog agent` on a windows host and monitor a remote FusionAuth Host.
Before  Installing and configuring the Prometheus agent, please install the prometeus integrations using similar steps as used in (Adding OpenMetrics Integration in Datadog)[## Adding OpenMetrics Integration in Datadog], but instead of searching for Openmetrics, search for (Prometheus)[https://us5.datadoghq.com/integrations/prometheus?search=Prometheus].

Navigate to the the agent download [page](https://us5.datadoghq.com/account/settings/agent/latest?platform=overview).
- Click on on Windows 
- If you have more than one API key , you can select the one to use. We only have one and will use that one.
- Also make sure of the region in our case it is "us5.datadoghq.com", but your's might vary depending on selection when you created your Datadog [account](### Signup for a free Datadog trial account.).
- Click Download Agent Installer.
- If asked, Choose a folder to save the download, otherwise it will be saved in you default downloads folder.
- Run the installer (as Administrator) by opening datadog-agent-7-latest.amd64.msi.
- Follow the prompts, accept the license agreement, and enter your Datadog API key 
- Then enter your Datadog Region: us5.datadoghq.com 
- When the install finishes, you are given the option to launch the Datadog Agent Manager.
- Launch the Datadog agent Manager

![Datadog-Agent-Windows-Setup](/img/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/datadog/datadog-agent-windows-setup.png)
- Make sure it has a green button at top that says "Connected to agent", if not please follow installation instructions again.
- Click on checks on the menu and select manage checks.
- select Prometheus from the list 
- On the right hand pane complete the following config for the remote Fusionauth server

![Datadog-Agent-Prometheus-Config](/img/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/datadog/datadog-agent-prometheus-config.png)

```yaml
## All options defined here are available to all instances.
init_config:
  
instances:
C:\Users\devi\Documents\git\fusion-auth_work\fusionauth-site\astro\public\img\docs\operate\secure-and-monitor\datadog-agent-prometheus-config.png  - prometheus_url: https://<your fusionauth host>/api/prometheus/metrics

    namespace: Prometheus_remote_metrics #namespace to identify requests in datadog

    metrics:
      - '*'  #you can filter or add specific metrics here , see documentation. 
    headers:
      Authorization: '<your Fusionauth apikey?
      Content-Type: 'application/json'
```

- When the config is done click on Add check to save.
- Click on Restart Agent.
- You can confirm on the Checks/Checksummary screen if everything is running ok

![Datadog-Agent-Prometheus-Check-Summary](/img/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/datadog/datadog-agent-prometheus-check-summary.png)

- Navigate to the Metrics explorer on the Datadog website.
- you can use the namespace we defined above  in the config `Prometheus_remote_metrics` and and add metrics in the metric explorer.
- Choose  last 15 minutes for the period  and you will see that data being pulled from the prometheus fusionauth endpoint.
- Following the steps above when we created a [dashboard](### Creating your first Dashboard), you can easily add this metrics to dashboards required.

## Sending Logs / Events with a python app to datadog

## Using the opentelemetry Colector to send data to Datadog 
We can also make use of the opentelemetery java colletor to push data from the fusionauth host to datadog.

We will modify the official FusionAuth Docker image to download the OpenTelemetry Java agent and change the script that starts FusionAuth. 
Configuration values for Java OpenTelemetry are described [here](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/java/configuration).

Save the `Dockerfile` from the [FusionAuth official image](https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/blob/master/docker/fusionauth/fusionauth-app/Dockerfile) to your computer. 

Edit the file. Above the paragraph labelled `###### Start FusionAuth App`, insert the code below.

```Dockerfile


```

This code edits `start.sh`, which is the command run when the container starts, to start FusionAuth using OpenTelemetry. The command takes the head of the file (all lines except the last), and writes the new command to the end of the file.

By default, the OpenTelemetry Java agent sends data to the OpenTelemetry collector at http://localhost:4317. You changed it to send data to the Splunk container, at http://otel:4318. (Splunk uses 4317 for RPC, not HTTP).

Build the Dockerfile into a new image to use in place of the official FusionAuth one.

```sh
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t faimage .
```

Modify the `docker-compose-yaml` file from the FusionAuth [five-minute guide](/docs/quickstarts/5-minute-setup-guide) to have the content below. You are now including the [Splunk OpenTelemetry](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/en/gdi/opentelemetry/collector-linux/install-linux-manual.html#linux-docker) container in your compose file. Replace the API key and realm with yours.

What Fusionauth data makes sense in a Datadog context? Only metrics or also logs etc?
How does Fusionauth feed data to Datadog? Pull, Push? Both options? 
Outline
Setting up the integration
Viewing Fusionauth data in Datadog
Steps
Sign up for a Datadog 14 day trial - Shout at Gareth if it needs credit card etc
Figure out how Fusionauth metrics work. Given this it might be a bit tricky
> ​​You can pull system metrics from the System API. The format of these metrics are evolving and thus are not documented.
Figure out how to ingest these into Datadog. This might require something like 
Create a basic Dashboard and show the Fusionauth metrics from fusionauth.ritza.co on Datadog
Write guide about how you did it and add it as a sibling page to https://fusionauth.io/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/prometheus
