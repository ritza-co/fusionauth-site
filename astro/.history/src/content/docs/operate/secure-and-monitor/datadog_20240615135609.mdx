## Introduction

In this guide, we will explain how to connect FusionAuth to Datadog through docker 
-	with the use of an OpenTelemetry Linux collector
- by using the Datadog Agent 
-  and adding logs or events using the Datadog API. 
We will create and set up a Datadog account and create a dashboard to monitor FusionAuth metrics.

> [Datadog integrates and automates infrastructure monitoring, application performance monitoring, log management, real-user monitoring, and many other capabilities to provide unified, real-time observability and security for our customers’ entire technology stack. Datadog is used by organizations of all sizes and across a wide range of industries to enable digital transformation and cloud migration, drive collaboration among development, operations, security and business teams, accelerate time to market for applications, reduce time to problem resolution, secure applications and infrastructure, understand user behavior, and track key business metrics.](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/application/)


## Datadog Setup

### Signup for a free Datadog trial account. 
- Navigate to Datadog [site](https://www.datadoghq.com/). 
- Click on the 'GET STARTED FREE' link and complete the form to get a 14-day trial. 
  <Aside type="note">
    Make a note of where you choose your data to be hosted as that will determine the URL you use later, for this guide we use United States (US5-Central) ).

![Signup-Datadog-Trail](/img/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/signup-datadog-trial.png)
- After completing the account registration you will be redirected to the 'agent intstallation' page. 


### Setup the Datadog Agent

The Datadog Agent collects metrics and events from your systems and apps. It can be installed anywhere, even on your workstation.
We will update FusionAuth DockerFile by adding the ubuntu agent in there
So click on the ubuntu agent and add this to the DockerFile..... describer  .... it should already contain your apikey
rebuild the DockerFile .. link to docker
```bash
DD_API_KEY=<yourapikey> DD_SITE="us5.datadoghq.com" bash -c "$(curl -L https://s3.amazonaws.com/dd-agent/scripts/install_script_agent7.sh)"
```
![Install-Datadog-Agent-Ubuntu](/img/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/install-datadog-agent-ubuntu.png)

Start the docker containers using dovker-compose .... link to get base docker-compose 
docker-compose.exe  -f .\docker-compose.yml  up     -d

  For more information or manual confuguration, or troubleshooting see the "Manual Step by Step Instructions on the agent setup page.

## TODO
Questions to answer
[Note: you don’t need to explicitly answer these questions, but the reader should have a good understanding of the answers after reading through the final document]
What Fusionauth data can be viewed in Datadog
What Fusionauth data makes sense in a Datadog context? Only metrics or also logs etc?
How does Fusionauth feed data to Datadog? Pull, Push? Both options? 
Outline
Setting up the integration
Viewing Fusionauth data in Datadog
Steps
Sign up for a Datadog 14 day trial - Shout at Gareth if it needs credit card etc
Figure out how Fusionauth metrics work. Given this it might be a bit tricky
> ​​You can pull system metrics from the System API. The format of these metrics are evolving and thus are not documented.
Figure out how to ingest these into Datadog. This might require something like 
Create a basic Dashboard and show the Fusionauth metrics from fusionauth.ritza.co on Datadog
Write guide about how you did it and add it as a sibling page to https://fusionauth.io/docs/operate/secure-and-monitor/prometheus
